The programming (II) is useful and important, and I learn many 
principle of the hard devices, or file process, or maldive bmp 
process from this course.

Ph. Chi's teaching is clear and organized,
and he is good at catching classmates eyes to concentrate in course.

A comment is about homework policy,
TA is deligent to deal with our homework score,
(I know programming TA is hard and suffered(?))
but TA should provide a homework policy to inform us
how judge our hw? 
TA only makes a comment as "(1)(3)(5)error" and lack of the detail about the hw policy(how to give credit?)

e.g, if hw1 (5) has 20 (scores), and I get 12 (scores),
he make a comment is "(5) error", and "8"(20-12) ......?
If I get 0 (scores), and he makes a comment is "(5) error"
it meant my program having a large mistakes, so I get nothing.
but ......I get 12, how he give this scores?

I hope the course provides more bonus.
Maybe teacher inform(suggest) us to take part in a OJ?
or a compepition? provide a bouns........opportunity.
p.s. Leetcode, VJ, or ... "NOJ"!? it's a good thought.
	bouns project?? bouns homework??
