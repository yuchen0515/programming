1
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,936
Sadly,

2
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,223
in the next 18 minutes when I do our chat,

3
00:00:22,247 --> 00:00:24,936
four Americans that are alive

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,008
will be dead through the food that they eat.

5
00:00:30,651 --> 00:00:32,026
My name's Jamie Oliver.

6
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,183
I'm 34 years old.

7
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:35,936
I'm from Essex in England

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,936
and for the last seven years

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,318
I've worked fairly tirelessly to save lives in my own way.

10
00:00:45,144 --> 00:00:46,936
I'm not a doctor;

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,137
I'm a chef,

12
00:00:48,161 --> 00:00:50,683
I don't have expensive equipment

13
00:00:50,707 --> 00:00:51,777
or medicine.

14
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:54,046
I use information, education.

15
00:00:55,285 --> 00:00:58,262
I profoundly believe that the power of food

16
00:00:58,286 --> 00:01:01,461
has a primal place in our homes

17
00:01:01,485 --> 00:01:05,936
that binds us to the best bits of life.

18
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,250
We have an awful, awful reality right now.

19
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:17,515
America, you're at the top of your game.

20
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,947
This is one of the most unhealthy countries in the world.

21
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,296
Can I please just see a raise of hands

22
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,899
for how many of you have children in this room today?

23
00:01:26,923 --> 00:01:28,023
Put your hands up.

24
00:01:28,348 --> 00:01:31,733
You can continue to put your hands up, aunties and uncles as well.

25
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,269
Most of you. OK.

26
00:01:34,293 --> 00:01:37,270
We, the adults of the last four generations,

27
00:01:37,294 --> 00:01:40,159
have blessed our children with the destiny

28
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:44,515
of a shorter lifespan than their own parents.

29
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:50,936
Your child will live a life ten years younger than you

30
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,936
because of the landscape of food that we've built around them.

31
00:01:55,355 --> 00:01:56,840
Two-thirds of this room,

32
00:01:56,864 --> 00:01:59,840
today, in America, are statistically overweight or obese.

33
00:02:00,194 --> 00:02:01,441
You lot, you're all right,

34
00:02:01,465 --> 00:02:03,480
but we'll get you eventually, don't worry.

35
00:02:03,504 --> 00:02:04,936
(Laughter)

36
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,936
The statistics of bad health are clear,

37
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,151
very clear.

38
00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:13,393
We spend our lives being paranoid about death, murder, homicide,

39
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:16,936
you name it; it's on the front page of every paper, CNN.

40
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,453
Look at homicide at the bottom, for God's sake.

41
00:02:20,358 --> 00:02:21,389
Right?

42
00:02:21,413 --> 00:02:22,936
(Laughter)

43
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,936
(Applause)

44
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,276
Every single one of those in the red is a diet-related disease.

45
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,888
Any doctor, any specialist will tell you that.

46
00:02:34,912 --> 00:02:38,199
Fact: diet-related disease is the biggest killer

47
00:02:38,223 --> 00:02:41,374
in the United States, right now, here today.

48
00:02:44,065 --> 00:02:45,522
This is a global problem.

49
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,682
It's a catastrophe.

50
00:02:47,706 --> 00:02:49,174
It's sweeping the world.

51
00:02:49,198 --> 00:02:51,411
England is right behind you, as usual.

52
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:56,380
(Laughter)

53
00:02:56,404 --> 00:02:58,427
I know they were close, but not that close.

54
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:00,474
We need a revolution.

55
00:03:00,498 --> 00:03:02,777
Mexico, Australia, Germany,

56
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:04,029
India, China,

57
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:07,164
all have massive problems of obesity and bad health.

58
00:03:08,745 --> 00:03:09,936
Think about smoking.

59
00:03:11,054 --> 00:03:12,936
It costs way less than obesity now.

60
00:03:13,697 --> 00:03:18,607
Obesity costs you Americans 10 percent of your health-care bills,

61
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:21,352
150 billion dollars a year.

62
00:03:23,034 --> 00:03:24,936
In 10 years, it's set to double:

63
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,453
300 billion dollars a year.

64
00:03:26,477 --> 00:03:28,853
Let's be honest, guys, you haven't got that cash.

65
00:03:28,877 --> 00:03:31,993
(Laughter)

66
00:03:32,785 --> 00:03:39,176
I came here to start a food revolution that I so profoundly believe in.

67
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,455
We need it. The time is now.

68
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:43,206
We're in a tipping-point moment.

69
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,015
I've been doing this for seven years.

70
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:47,202
I've been trying in America for seven years.

71
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:51,110
Now is the time when it's ripe -- ripe for the picking.

72
00:03:51,134 --> 00:03:52,936
I went to the eye of the storm.

73
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,889
I went to West Virginia, the most unhealthy state in America.

74
00:03:55,913 --> 00:03:56,952
Or it was last year.

75
00:03:56,976 --> 00:04:00,215
We've got a new one this year, but we'll work on that next season.

76
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,122
(Laughter)

77
00:04:02,146 --> 00:04:04,169
Huntington, West Virginia. Beautiful town.

78
00:04:04,193 --> 00:04:07,690
I wanted to put heart and soul and people,

79
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,469
your public,

80
00:04:09,493 --> 00:04:12,984
around the statistics that we've become so used to.

81
00:04:13,364 --> 00:04:16,364
I want to introduce you to some of the people that I care about:

82
00:04:16,388 --> 00:04:18,008
your public, your children.

83
00:04:18,032 --> 00:04:20,581
I want to show a picture of my friend Brittany.

84
00:04:20,605 --> 00:04:22,278
She's 16 years old.

85
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:26,378
She's got six years to live

86
00:04:26,402 --> 00:04:28,936
because of the food that she's eaten.

87
00:04:29,244 --> 00:04:31,348
She's the third generation of Americans

88
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:33,563
that hasn't grown up within a food environment

89
00:04:33,587 --> 00:04:36,176
where they've been taught to cook at home or in school,

90
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,207
or her mom, or her mom's mom.

91
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:40,413
She has six years to live.

92
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,721
She's eating her liver to death.

93
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,856
Stacy, the Edwards family.

94
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:48,221
This is a normal family, guys.

95
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,786
Stacy does her best, but she's third-generation as well;

96
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,159
she was never taught to cook at home or at school.

97
00:04:54,183 --> 00:04:55,318
The family's obese.

98
00:04:55,342 --> 00:04:58,063
Justin here, 12 years old, he's 350 pounds.

99
00:04:58,087 --> 00:04:59,755
He gets bullied, for God's sake.

100
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:02,246
The daughter there, Katie, she's four years old.

101
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,778
She's obese before she even gets to primary school.

102
00:05:05,294 --> 00:05:07,936
Marissa, she's all right, she's one of your lot.

103
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:09,265
But you know what?

104
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:12,647
Her father, who was obese, died in her arms,

105
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:15,075
And then the second most important man in her life,

106
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:17,623
her uncle, died of obesity,

107
00:05:17,647 --> 00:05:19,552
and now her step-dad is obese.

108
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,513
You see, the thing is,

109
00:05:22,537 --> 00:05:24,936
obesity and diet-related disease

110
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,960
doesn't just hurt the people that have it;

111
00:05:26,984 --> 00:05:29,609
it's all of their friends, families, brothers, sisters.

112
00:05:31,173 --> 00:05:32,936
Pastor Steve:

113
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,397
an inspirational man,

114
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:36,935
one of my early allies in Huntington, West Virginia.

115
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:40,743
He's at the sharp knife-edge of this problem.

116
00:05:41,235 --> 00:05:43,219
He has to bury the people, OK?

117
00:05:43,592 --> 00:05:44,772
And he's fed up with it.

118
00:05:44,796 --> 00:05:47,838
He's fed up with burying his friends, his family, his community.

119
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:51,095
Come winter, three times as many people die.

120
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,531
He's sick of it.

121
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,626
This is preventable disease. Waste of life.

122
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,039
By the way, this is what they get buried in.

123
00:05:59,285 --> 00:06:00,968
We're not geared up to do this.

124
00:06:02,063 --> 00:06:04,691
Can't even get them out the door, and I'm being serious.

125
00:06:04,715 --> 00:06:06,436
Can't even get them there. Forklift.

126
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,584
OK, I see it as a triangle, OK?

127
00:06:09,608 --> 00:06:11,140
This is our landscape of food.

128
00:06:11,164 --> 00:06:12,521
I need you to understand it.

129
00:06:12,545 --> 00:06:14,609
You've probably heard all this before.

130
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:15,919
Over the last 30 years,

131
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:18,776
what's happened that's ripped the heart out of this country?

132
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,041
Let's be frank and honest.

133
00:06:21,484 --> 00:06:23,684
Well, modern-day life.

134
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,333
Let's start with the Main Street.

135
00:06:26,087 --> 00:06:28,771
Fast food has taken over the whole country; we know that.

136
00:06:28,795 --> 00:06:31,599
The big brands are some of the most important powers,

137
00:06:31,623 --> 00:06:33,463
powerful powers, in this country.

138
00:06:34,073 --> 00:06:35,074
(Sighs)

139
00:06:35,098 --> 00:06:36,397
Supermarkets as well.

140
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,816
Big companies. Big companies.

141
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:42,191
Thirty years ago, most of the food

142
00:06:42,215 --> 00:06:44,936
was largely local and largely fresh.

143
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,319
Now it's largely processed and full of all sorts of additives,

144
00:06:48,343 --> 00:06:51,034
extra ingredients, and you know the rest of the story.

145
00:06:51,058 --> 00:06:53,936
Portion size is obviously a massive, massive problem.

146
00:06:55,637 --> 00:06:57,476
Labeling is a massive problem.

147
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,460
The labeling in this country is a disgrace.

148
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:05,905
The industry wants to self-police themselves.

149
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,515
What, in this kind of climate? They don't deserve it.

150
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:12,805
How can you say something is low-fat when it's full of so much sugar?

151
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:15,051
Home.

152
00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:18,808
The biggest problem with the home

153
00:07:18,832 --> 00:07:23,936
is that used to be the heart of passing on food culture,

154
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,384
what made our society.

155
00:07:26,408 --> 00:07:27,841
That is not happening anymore.

156
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:30,746
And you know, as we go to work and as life changes,

157
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,747
and as life always evolves,

158
00:07:32,771 --> 00:07:34,884
we kind of have to look at it holistically --

159
00:07:34,908 --> 00:07:37,296
step back for a moment, and re-address the balance.

160
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,383
It hasn't happened for 30 years, OK?

161
00:07:40,364 --> 00:07:43,722
I want to show you a situation

162
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:46,987
that is very normal right now; the Edwards family.

163
00:07:47,602 --> 00:07:49,578
(Video) Jamie Oliver: Let's have a talk.

164
00:07:50,432 --> 00:07:54,465
This stuff goes through you and your family's body every week.

165
00:07:54,489 --> 00:07:56,398
And I need you to know

166
00:07:56,422 --> 00:07:59,992
that this is going to kill your children early.

167
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,960
How are you feeling?

168
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:05,936
Stacy: Just feeling really sad and depressed right now.

169
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,763
But, you know, I want my kids to succeed in life

170
00:08:09,787 --> 00:08:11,936
and this isn't going to get them there.

171
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:14,265
But I'm killing them.

172
00:08:15,675 --> 00:08:18,651
JO: Yes you are. You are.

173
00:08:18,675 --> 00:08:19,887
But we can stop that.

174
00:08:23,777 --> 00:08:24,851
Normal.

175
00:08:26,026 --> 00:08:27,860
Let's get on schools,

176
00:08:27,884 --> 00:08:30,936
something that I'm fairly much a specialist in.

177
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,497
OK, school.

178
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,936
What is school? Who invented it? What's the purpose of school?

179
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,792
School was always invented to arm us with the tools

180
00:08:38,816 --> 00:08:41,635
to make us creative, do wonderful things,

181
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:44,116
make us earn a living, etc., etc.

182
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,298
You know, it's been kind of in this sort of tight box for a long, long time, OK?

183
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,936
But we haven't really evolved it

184
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,290
to deal with the health catastrophes of America, OK?

185
00:08:54,314 --> 00:08:57,401
School food is something

186
00:08:57,425 --> 00:09:00,083
that most kids -- 31 million a day, actually --

187
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:04,768
have twice a day, more than often, breakfast and lunch,

188
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:06,521
180 days of the year.

189
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:09,720
So you could say that school food is quite important, really,

190
00:09:09,744 --> 00:09:11,330
judging the circumstances.

191
00:09:11,354 --> 00:09:15,370
(Laughter)

192
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:18,936
Before I crack into my rant,

193
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,986
which I'm sure you're waiting for --

194
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:24,057
(Laughter)

195
00:09:24,081 --> 00:09:26,447
I need to say one thing, and it's so important

196
00:09:26,471 --> 00:09:29,178
in, hopefully, the magic that happens and unfolds

197
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:30,415
in the next three months.

198
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,249
The lunch ladies, the lunch cooks of America --

199
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:37,648
I offer myself as their ambassador.

200
00:09:37,672 --> 00:09:39,158
I'm not slagging them off.

201
00:09:39,182 --> 00:09:41,182
They're doing the best they can do.

202
00:09:43,848 --> 00:09:45,260
They're doing their best.

203
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,792
But they're doing what they're told,

204
00:09:47,816 --> 00:09:50,077
and what they're being told to do is wrong.

205
00:09:50,396 --> 00:09:53,633
The system is highly run by accountants;

206
00:09:53,657 --> 00:09:57,734
there's not enough, or any, food-knowledgeable people in the business.

207
00:09:57,758 --> 00:09:58,789
There's a problem:

208
00:09:58,813 --> 00:10:01,936
If you're not a food expert, and you've got tight budgets

209
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,670
and it's getting tighter, then you can't be creative,

210
00:10:04,694 --> 00:10:07,833
you can't duck and dive and write different things around things.

211
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,864
If you're an accountant, and a box-ticker,

212
00:10:09,888 --> 00:10:12,134
the only thing you can do in these circumstances

213
00:10:12,158 --> 00:10:13,186
is buy cheaper shit.

214
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,540
Now, the reality is,

215
00:10:14,564 --> 00:10:18,175
the food that your kids get every day is fast food,

216
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:19,508
it's highly processed,

217
00:10:19,532 --> 00:10:21,772
there's not enough fresh food in there at all.

218
00:10:21,796 --> 00:10:23,977
You know, the amount of additives, E numbers,

219
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:25,707
ingredients you wouldn't believe --

220
00:10:25,731 --> 00:10:27,442
there's not enough veggies at all.

221
00:10:27,466 --> 00:10:29,390
French fries are considered a vegetable.

222
00:10:29,414 --> 00:10:31,936
Pizza for breakfast. They don't even get crockery.

223
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,292
Knives and forks? No, they're too dangerous.

224
00:10:35,117 --> 00:10:36,857
They have scissors in the classroom,

225
00:10:36,881 --> 00:10:38,262
but knives and forks? No.

226
00:10:38,286 --> 00:10:39,682
And the way I look at it is:

227
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:42,095
If you don't have knives and forks in your school,

228
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:43,658
you're purely endorsing,

229
00:10:43,682 --> 00:10:46,754
from a state level, fast food, because it's handheld.

230
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:48,563
And yes, by the way, it is fast food:

231
00:10:48,587 --> 00:10:50,177
It's sloppy Joes, it's burgers,

232
00:10:50,201 --> 00:10:52,977
it's wieners, it's pizzas, it's all of that stuff.

233
00:10:54,225 --> 00:10:55,664
(Sighs)

234
00:10:56,412 --> 00:10:59,389
Ten percent of what we spend on health care, as I said earlier,

235
00:10:59,413 --> 00:11:01,848
is on obesity, and it's going to double.

236
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,540
We're not teaching our kids.

237
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:07,269
There's no statutory right to teach kids about food,

238
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:09,086
elementary or secondary school, OK?

239
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,428
We don't teach kids about food, right?

240
00:11:11,452 --> 00:11:13,881
And this is a little clip from an elementary school,

241
00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:15,484
which is very common in England.

242
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,489
(Video) Who knows what this is?

243
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:20,584
Child: Potatoes.

244
00:11:20,608 --> 00:11:23,196
Jamie Oliver: Potato? So, you think these are potatoes?

245
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,441
Do you know what that is?

246
00:11:24,754 --> 00:11:25,958
Do you know what that is?

247
00:11:25,982 --> 00:11:26,997
Child: Broccoli?

248
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:29,477
JO: What about this? Our good old friend.

249
00:11:29,501 --> 00:11:30,661
Child: Celery.

250
00:11:30,685 --> 00:11:32,629
JO: No. What do you think this is?

251
00:11:32,653 --> 00:11:34,137
Child: Onion. JO: Onion? No.

252
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:36,567
JO: Immediately you get a really clear sense

253
00:11:36,591 --> 00:11:39,811
of "Do the kids know anything about where food comes from?"

254
00:11:39,835 --> 00:11:41,812
Who knows what that is? Child: Uh, pear?

255
00:11:41,836 --> 00:11:44,264
JO: What do you think this is? Child: I don't know.

256
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:46,272
JO: If the kids don't know what stuff is,

257
00:11:46,296 --> 00:11:47,695
then they will never eat it.

258
00:11:49,883 --> 00:11:51,140
(Laughter)

259
00:11:51,164 --> 00:11:53,936
JO: Normal. England and America,

260
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,498
England and America.

261
00:11:55,522 --> 00:11:57,665
Guess what fixed that.

262
00:11:58,127 --> 00:11:59,600
Two one-hour sessions.

263
00:12:01,171 --> 00:12:04,560
We've got to start teaching our kids about food in schools, period.

264
00:12:05,396 --> 00:12:10,936
(Applause)

265
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,981
I want to tell you about something

266
00:12:15,005 --> 00:12:19,343
that kind of epitomizes the trouble that we're in, guys, OK?

267
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:21,938
I want to talk about something so basic as milk.

268
00:12:22,602 --> 00:12:24,603
Every kid has the right to milk at school.

269
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:28,223
Your kids will be having milk at school, breakfast and lunch, right?

270
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,045
They'll be having two bottles, OK?

271
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:31,562
And most kids do.

272
00:12:31,586 --> 00:12:34,371
But milk ain't good enough anymore.

273
00:12:34,395 --> 00:12:36,936
Don't get me wrong, I support milk --

274
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,076
but someone at the milk board

275
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,770
probably paid a lot of money for some geezer to work out

276
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,535
that if you put loads of flavorings,

277
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:44,982
colorings and sugar in milk,

278
00:12:45,006 --> 00:12:46,424
more kids will drink it.

279
00:12:47,665 --> 00:12:48,665
Yeah.

280
00:12:49,181 --> 00:12:51,134
Obviously now that's going to catch on

281
00:12:51,158 --> 00:12:52,944
the apple board is going to work out

282
00:12:52,968 --> 00:12:55,745
that if they make toffee apples they'll eat more as well.

283
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:57,182
Do you know what I mean?

284
00:12:57,206 --> 00:13:00,253
For me, there isn't any need to flavor the milk.

285
00:13:00,277 --> 00:13:02,300
Okay? There's sugar in everything.

286
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:04,473
I know the ins and outs of those ingredients.

287
00:13:04,497 --> 00:13:05,523
It's in everything.

288
00:13:05,547 --> 00:13:09,125
Even the milk hasn't escaped the kind of modern-day problems.

289
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:10,936
There's our milk. There's our carton.

290
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,209
In that is nearly as much sugar as one of your favorite cans of fizzy pop,

291
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:16,669
and they are having two a day.

292
00:13:16,693 --> 00:13:18,248
So, let me just show you.

293
00:13:18,272 --> 00:13:21,354
We've got one kid, here --

294
00:13:23,047 --> 00:13:26,859
having, you know, eight tablespoons of sugar a day.

295
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:29,705
You know, there's your week.

296
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,316
There's your month.

297
00:13:33,538 --> 00:13:35,733
And I've taken the liberty of putting in

298
00:13:35,757 --> 00:13:38,757
just the five years of elementary school sugar,

299
00:13:42,413 --> 00:13:43,611
just from milk.

300
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,780
Now, I don't know about you guys,

301
00:13:48,804 --> 00:13:51,621
but judging the circumstances, right,

302
00:13:51,645 --> 00:13:53,936
any judge in the whole world,

303
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,424
would look at the statistics and the evidence,

304
00:13:56,448 --> 00:13:59,733
and they would find any government of old guilty of child abuse.

305
00:14:00,288 --> 00:14:01,392
That's my belief.

306
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:04,416
(Applause)

307
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:09,936
(Applause ends)

308
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,252
Now, if I came up here, and I wish I could come up here today

309
00:14:13,276 --> 00:14:15,937
and hang a cure for AIDS or cancer,

310
00:14:15,961 --> 00:14:18,411
you'd be fighting and scrambling to get to me.

311
00:14:19,444 --> 00:14:22,420
This, all this bad news, is preventable.

312
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,471
That's the good news.

313
00:14:24,495 --> 00:14:26,471
It's very, very preventable.

314
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,936
So, let's just think about, we got a problem here,

315
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,078
we need to reboot.

316
00:14:32,293 --> 00:14:34,936
Okay so, in my world, what do we need to do?

317
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,675
Here is the thing, right,

318
00:14:36,699 --> 00:14:38,936
it cannot just come from one source.

319
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,367
To reboot and make real tangible change,

320
00:14:42,391 --> 00:14:45,335
real change, so that I could look you in the white of the eyes

321
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:46,936
and say, "In 10 years' time,

322
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,936
the history of your children's lives,

323
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,008
happiness -- and let's not forget, you're clever if you eat well,

324
00:14:52,032 --> 00:14:53,890
you know you're going to live longer --

325
00:14:53,914 --> 00:14:56,847
all of that stuff, it will look different. OK?"

326
00:14:57,566 --> 00:14:59,272
So, supermarkets.

327
00:14:59,296 --> 00:15:01,216
Where else do you shop so religiously?

328
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,428
Week in, week out.

329
00:15:02,452 --> 00:15:05,531
How much money do you spend, in your life, in a supermarket?

330
00:15:05,555 --> 00:15:06,563
Love them.

331
00:15:06,587 --> 00:15:08,643
They just sell us what we want. All right.

332
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:13,126
They owe us to put a food ambassador in every major supermarket.

333
00:15:13,642 --> 00:15:15,222
They need to help us shop.

334
00:15:15,246 --> 00:15:18,936
They need to show us how to cook quick, tasty, seasonal meals

335
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,825
for people that are busy.

336
00:15:20,849 --> 00:15:22,818
This is not expensive.

337
00:15:22,842 --> 00:15:25,723
It is done in some, and it needs to be done across the board

338
00:15:25,747 --> 00:15:27,452
in America soon, and quick.

339
00:15:27,824 --> 00:15:30,801
The big brands, you know, the food brands,

340
00:15:30,825 --> 00:15:34,550
need to put food education at the heart of their businesses.

341
00:15:34,574 --> 00:15:36,454
I know, easier said than done.

342
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,689
It's the future. It's the only way.

343
00:15:38,713 --> 00:15:40,334
Fast food.

344
00:15:40,358 --> 00:15:43,118
With the fast-food industry

345
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,936
you know, it's very competitive.

346
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,055
I've had loads of secret papers and dealings

347
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,797
with fast food restaurants.

348
00:15:48,821 --> 00:15:50,638
I know how they do it.

349
00:15:50,662 --> 00:15:52,935
I mean, basically they've weaned us on

350
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,738
to these hits of sugar, salt and fat, and x, y, and z,

351
00:15:55,762 --> 00:15:57,739
and everyone loves them, right?

352
00:15:57,763 --> 00:16:00,959
So, these guys are going to be part of the solution.

353
00:16:00,983 --> 00:16:02,936
But we need to get the government to work

354
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,008
with all of the fast food purveyors and the restaurant industry,

355
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:08,081
and over a five, six, seven year period

356
00:16:08,105 --> 00:16:10,424
wean of us off the extreme amounts

357
00:16:10,448 --> 00:16:13,936
of fat, sugar and all the other non-food ingredients.

358
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,242
Now, also, back to the sort of big brands:

359
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:19,448
labeling, I said earlier, is an absolute farce

360
00:16:19,472 --> 00:16:20,883
and has got to be sorted.

361
00:16:22,263 --> 00:16:23,588
OK, school.

362
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,936
Obviously, in schools, we owe it to them

363
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,936
to make sure those 180 days of the year,

364
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,936
from that little precious age of four,

365
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,936
until 18, 20, 24, whatever,

366
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,811
they need to be cooked proper, fresh food

367
00:16:37,835 --> 00:16:39,936
from local growers on site, OK?

368
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,486
There needs to be a new standard of fresh, proper food

369
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,936
for your children, yeah?

370
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:48,389
(Applause)

371
00:16:48,413 --> 00:16:51,849
Under the circumstances, it's profoundly important

372
00:16:51,873 --> 00:16:54,442
that every single American child leaves school

373
00:16:54,466 --> 00:16:56,443
knowing how to cook 10 recipes

374
00:16:56,467 --> 00:16:57,816
that will save their life.

375
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,039
Life skills.

376
00:17:00,063 --> 00:17:02,260
(Applause)

377
00:17:02,284 --> 00:17:05,322
That means that they can be students, young parents,

378
00:17:05,346 --> 00:17:09,585
and be able to sort of duck and dive around the basics of cooking,

379
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:11,712
no matter what recession hits them next time.

380
00:17:11,736 --> 00:17:14,118
If you can cook, recession money doesn't matter.

381
00:17:14,142 --> 00:17:16,613
If you can cook, time doesn't matter.

382
00:17:18,155 --> 00:17:20,600
The workplace, we haven't really talked about it.

383
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:24,186
You know, it's now time for corporate responsibility

384
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:28,234
to really look at what they feed or make available to their staff.

385
00:17:28,258 --> 00:17:31,568
The staff are the moms and dads of America's children.

386
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,751
Marissa, her father died in her hand,

387
00:17:33,775 --> 00:17:35,752
I think she'd be quite happy

388
00:17:35,776 --> 00:17:38,936
if corporate America could start feeding their staff properly.

389
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,936
Definitely they shouldn't be left out.

390
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,526
Let's go back to the home.

391
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,790
Now, look, if we do all this stuff, and we can,

392
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:45,887
it's so achievable.

393
00:17:45,911 --> 00:17:47,653
You can care and be commercial.

394
00:17:47,677 --> 00:17:48,700
Absolutely.

395
00:17:48,724 --> 00:17:53,719
But the home needs to start passing on cooking again, for sure.

396
00:17:53,743 --> 00:17:55,719
For sure, pass it on as a philosophy.

397
00:17:56,233 --> 00:17:57,877
And for me, it's quite romantic,

398
00:17:57,901 --> 00:18:00,294
but it's about if one person teaches three people

399
00:18:00,318 --> 00:18:01,936
how to cook something,

400
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,700
and they teach three of their mates,

401
00:18:03,724 --> 00:18:06,048
that only has to repeat itself 25 times,

402
00:18:06,072 --> 00:18:08,327
and that's the whole population of America.

403
00:18:08,351 --> 00:18:12,651
Romantic, yes, but most importantly,

404
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:15,366
it's about trying to get people to realize

405
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,374
that every one of your individual efforts makes a difference.

406
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:20,598
We've got to put back what's been lost.

407
00:18:21,092 --> 00:18:22,314
Huntington's Kitchen.

408
00:18:22,955 --> 00:18:25,226
Huntington, where I made this program,

409
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,837
we've got this prime-time program

410
00:18:26,861 --> 00:18:30,049
that hopefully will inspire people to really get on this change.

411
00:18:30,073 --> 00:18:32,104
I truly believe that change will happen.

412
00:18:32,128 --> 00:18:34,295
Huntington's Kitchen. I work with a community.

413
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,800
I worked in the schools.

414
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:38,089
I found local sustainable funding

415
00:18:38,113 --> 00:18:42,399
to get every single school in the area from the junk, onto the fresh food:

416
00:18:42,423 --> 00:18:44,292
six-and-a-half grand per school.

417
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,166
(Applause)

418
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,686
That's all it takes, six-and-a-half grand per school.

419
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,113
The Kitchen is 25 grand a month. Okay?

420
00:18:51,137 --> 00:18:54,012
This can do 5,000 people a year,

421
00:18:54,036 --> 00:18:56,154
which is 10 percent of their population,

422
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:57,559
and it's people on people.

423
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,884
You know, it's local cooks teaching local people.

424
00:18:59,908 --> 00:19:03,494
It's free cooking lessons, guys, in the Main Street.

425
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,647
This is real, tangible change, real, tangible change.

426
00:19:08,444 --> 00:19:11,466
Around America, if we just look back now,

427
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,893
there is plenty of wonderful things going on.

428
00:19:14,594 --> 00:19:16,703
There is plenty of beautiful things going on.

429
00:19:16,727 --> 00:19:19,936
There are angels around America doing great things

430
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,857
in schools -- farm-to-school set-ups,

431
00:19:22,881 --> 00:19:25,492
garden set-ups, education --

432
00:19:25,516 --> 00:19:27,613
there are amazing people doing this already.

433
00:19:27,637 --> 00:19:29,566
The problem is they all want to roll out

434
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,725
what they're doing to the next school,

435
00:19:31,749 --> 00:19:33,097
but there's no cash.

436
00:19:34,017 --> 00:19:37,717
We need to recognize the experts and the angels quickly,

437
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:40,936
identify them, and allow them to easily find the resource

438
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,200
to keep rolling out what they're already doing,

439
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:44,224
and doing well.

440
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,080
Businesses of America need to support

441
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:49,936
Mrs. Obama to do the things that she wants to do.

442
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:56,359
(Applause)

443
00:19:56,383 --> 00:19:58,329
And look, I know it's weird

444
00:19:58,353 --> 00:20:00,936
having an English person standing here before you

445
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,401
talking about all this.

446
00:20:02,425 --> 00:20:03,773
All I can say is: I care.

447
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:05,751
I'm a father,

448
00:20:05,775 --> 00:20:07,116
and I love this country.

449
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,562
And I believe truly, actually,

450
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:13,435
that if change can be made in this country,

451
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:15,642
beautiful things will happen around the world.

452
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,801
If America does it, other people will follow.

453
00:20:17,825 --> 00:20:19,221
It's incredibly important.

454
00:20:19,597 --> 00:20:20,665
(Audience) Yeah!

455
00:20:20,689 --> 00:20:26,320
(Applause)

456
00:20:26,344 --> 00:20:27,622
When I was in Huntington,

457
00:20:27,646 --> 00:20:30,270
trying to get a few things to work when they weren't,

458
00:20:30,294 --> 00:20:35,605
I thought "If I had a magic wand, what would I do?"

459
00:20:35,629 --> 00:20:37,186
And I thought, "You know what?

460
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:40,493
I'd just love to be put in front of some of the most amazing

461
00:20:40,517 --> 00:20:42,281
movers and shakers in America."

462
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:46,288
And a month later, TED phoned me up and gave me this award.

463
00:20:47,753 --> 00:20:48,808
I'm here.

464
00:20:51,475 --> 00:20:52,657
So, my wish.

465
00:20:57,695 --> 00:20:59,457
Dyslexic, so I'm a bit slow.

466
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,936
My wish

467
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,091
is for you to help a strong, sustainable movement

468
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:14,789
to educate every child

469
00:21:14,813 --> 00:21:17,201
about food,

470
00:21:17,225 --> 00:21:20,740
to inspire families to cook again,

471
00:21:20,764 --> 00:21:23,425
and to empower people everywhere

472
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:24,972
to fight obesity.

473
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,064
(Applause)

474
00:21:36,203 --> 00:21:37,256
Thank you.

475
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,280
(Applause continues)
