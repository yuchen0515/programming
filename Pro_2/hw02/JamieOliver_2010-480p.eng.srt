1
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:14,735
Sadly,

2
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,022
in the next 18 minutes when I do our chat,

3
00:00:18,046 --> 00:00:20,735
four Americans that are alive

4
00:00:20,759 --> 00:00:23,807
will be dead through the food that they eat.

5
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,825
My name's Jamie Oliver.

6
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:28,982
I'm 34 years old.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,735
I'm from Essex in England

8
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:34,735
and for the last seven years

9
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:40,117
I've worked fairly tirelessly to save lives in my own way.

10
00:00:40,943 --> 00:00:42,735
I'm not a doctor;

11
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:43,936
I'm a chef,

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,482
I don't have expensive equipment

13
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:47,576
or medicine.

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,845
I use information, education.

15
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:54,061
I profoundly believe that the power of food

16
00:00:54,085 --> 00:00:57,260
has a primal place in our homes

17
00:00:57,284 --> 00:01:01,735
that binds us to the best bits of life.

18
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:09,049
We have an awful, awful reality right now.

19
00:01:10,338 --> 00:01:13,314
America, you're at the top of your game.

20
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:16,746
This is one of the most unhealthy countries in the world.

21
00:01:17,449 --> 00:01:20,095
Can I please just see a raise of hands

22
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:22,698
for how many of you have children in this room today?

23
00:01:22,722 --> 00:01:23,822
Put your hands up.

24
00:01:24,147 --> 00:01:27,532
You can continue to put your hands up, aunties and uncles as well.

25
00:01:28,091 --> 00:01:30,068
Most of you. OK.

26
00:01:30,092 --> 00:01:33,069
We, the adults of the last four generations,

27
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,958
have blessed our children with the destiny

28
00:01:35,982 --> 00:01:40,314
of a shorter lifespan than their own parents.

29
00:01:41,838 --> 00:01:46,735
Your child will live a life ten years younger than you

30
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:49,735
because of the landscape of food that we've built around them.

31
00:01:51,154 --> 00:01:52,639
Two-thirds of this room,

32
00:01:52,663 --> 00:01:55,639
today, in America, are statistically overweight or obese.

33
00:01:55,993 --> 00:01:57,240
You lot, you're all right,

34
00:01:57,264 --> 00:01:59,279
but we'll get you eventually, don't worry.

35
00:01:59,303 --> 00:02:00,735
(Laughter)

36
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:03,735
The statistics of bad health are clear,

37
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:04,950
very clear.

38
00:02:05,568 --> 00:02:09,192
We spend our lives being paranoid about death, murder, homicide,

39
00:02:09,216 --> 00:02:12,735
you name it; it's on the front page of every paper, CNN.

40
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:15,252
Look at homicide at the bottom, for God's sake.

41
00:02:16,157 --> 00:02:17,188
Right?

42
00:02:17,212 --> 00:02:18,735
(Laughter)

43
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:23,735
(Applause)

44
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:28,075
Every single one of those in the red is a diet-related disease.

45
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:30,687
Any doctor, any specialist will tell you that.

46
00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:33,998
Fact: diet-related disease is the biggest killer

47
00:02:34,022 --> 00:02:37,173
in the United States, right now, here today.

48
00:02:39,864 --> 00:02:41,321
This is a global problem.

49
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,481
It's a catastrophe.

50
00:02:43,505 --> 00:02:44,973
It's sweeping the world.

51
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:47,210
England is right behind you, as usual.

52
00:02:47,972 --> 00:02:52,179
(Laughter)

53
00:02:52,203 --> 00:02:54,226
I know they were close, but not that close.

54
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,273
We need a revolution.

55
00:02:56,297 --> 00:02:58,576
Mexico, Australia, Germany,

56
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,828
India, China,

57
00:02:59,852 --> 00:03:02,963
all have massive problems of obesity and bad health.

58
00:03:04,544 --> 00:03:05,735
Think about smoking.

59
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,735
It costs way less than obesity now.

60
00:03:09,496 --> 00:03:14,406
Obesity costs you Americans 10 percent of your health-care bills,

61
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,151
150 billion dollars a year.

62
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,735
In 10 years, it's set to double:

63
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,252
300 billion dollars a year.

64
00:03:22,276 --> 00:03:24,652
Let's be honest, guys, you haven't got that cash.

65
00:03:24,676 --> 00:03:27,792
(Laughter)

66
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:34,975
I came here to start a food revolution that I so profoundly believe in.

67
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:37,254
We need it. The time is now.

68
00:03:37,278 --> 00:03:39,005
We're in a tipping-point moment.

69
00:03:39,029 --> 00:03:40,814
I've been doing this for seven years.

70
00:03:40,838 --> 00:03:43,001
I've been trying in America for seven years.

71
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:46,909
Now is the time when it's ripe -- ripe for the picking.

72
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:48,735
I went to the eye of the storm.

73
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:51,688
I went to West Virginia, the most unhealthy state in America.

74
00:03:51,712 --> 00:03:52,751
Or it was last year.

75
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:56,014
We've got a new one this year, but we'll work on that next season.

76
00:03:56,038 --> 00:03:57,921
(Laughter)

77
00:03:57,945 --> 00:03:59,968
Huntington, West Virginia. Beautiful town.

78
00:03:59,992 --> 00:04:03,489
I wanted to put heart and soul and people,

79
00:04:03,513 --> 00:04:05,268
your public,

80
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:08,783
around the statistics that we've become so used to.

81
00:04:09,163 --> 00:04:12,163
I want to introduce you to some of the people that I care about:

82
00:04:12,187 --> 00:04:13,807
your public, your children.

83
00:04:13,831 --> 00:04:16,380
I want to show a picture of my friend Brittany.

84
00:04:16,404 --> 00:04:18,077
She's 16 years old.

85
00:04:18,687 --> 00:04:22,177
She's got six years to live

86
00:04:22,201 --> 00:04:24,735
because of the food that she's eaten.

87
00:04:25,043 --> 00:04:27,147
She's the third generation of Americans

88
00:04:27,171 --> 00:04:29,362
that hasn't grown up within a food environment

89
00:04:29,386 --> 00:04:31,975
where they've been taught to cook at home or in school,

90
00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:34,006
or her mom, or her mom's mom.

91
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,212
She has six years to live.

92
00:04:37,346 --> 00:04:39,520
She's eating her liver to death.

93
00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:41,655
Stacy, the Edwards family.

94
00:04:42,172 --> 00:04:44,020
This is a normal family, guys.

95
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,585
Stacy does her best, but she's third-generation as well;

96
00:04:47,609 --> 00:04:49,958
she was never taught to cook at home or at school.

97
00:04:49,982 --> 00:04:51,117
The family's obese.

98
00:04:51,141 --> 00:04:53,862
Justin here, 12 years old, he's 350 pounds.

99
00:04:53,886 --> 00:04:55,554
He gets bullied, for God's sake.

100
00:04:55,578 --> 00:04:58,045
The daughter there, Katie, she's four years old.

101
00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:00,577
She's obese before she even gets to primary school.

102
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:03,735
Marissa, she's all right, she's one of your lot.

103
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,064
But you know what?

104
00:05:05,088 --> 00:05:08,446
Her father, who was obese, died in her arms,

105
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,874
And then the second most important man in her life,

106
00:05:10,898 --> 00:05:13,422
her uncle, died of obesity,

107
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,351
and now her step-dad is obese.

108
00:05:16,536 --> 00:05:18,312
You see, the thing is,

109
00:05:18,336 --> 00:05:20,735
obesity and diet-related disease

110
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,759
doesn't just hurt the people that have it;

111
00:05:22,783 --> 00:05:25,408
it's all of their friends, families, brothers, sisters.

112
00:05:26,972 --> 00:05:28,735
Pastor Steve:

113
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,196
an inspirational man,

114
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,734
one of my early allies in Huntington, West Virginia.

115
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,542
He's at the sharp knife-edge of this problem.

116
00:05:37,034 --> 00:05:39,018
He has to bury the people, OK?

117
00:05:39,391 --> 00:05:40,571
And he's fed up with it.

118
00:05:40,595 --> 00:05:43,637
He's fed up with burying his friends, his family, his community.

119
00:05:43,946 --> 00:05:46,894
Come winter, three times as many people die.

120
00:05:47,275 --> 00:05:48,330
He's sick of it.

121
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:51,425
This is preventable disease. Waste of life.

122
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,838
By the way, this is what they get buried in.

123
00:05:55,084 --> 00:05:56,767
We're not geared up to do this.

124
00:05:57,862 --> 00:06:00,490
Can't even get them out the door, and I'm being serious.

125
00:06:00,514 --> 00:06:02,235
Can't even get them there. Forklift.

126
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,383
OK, I see it as a triangle, OK?

127
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,939
This is our landscape of food.

128
00:06:06,963 --> 00:06:08,320
I need you to understand it.

129
00:06:08,344 --> 00:06:10,408
You've probably heard all this before.

130
00:06:10,432 --> 00:06:11,718
Over the last 30 years,

131
00:06:11,742 --> 00:06:14,575
what's happened that's ripped the heart out of this country?

132
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:15,840
Let's be frank and honest.

133
00:06:17,283 --> 00:06:19,483
Well, modern-day life.

134
00:06:19,507 --> 00:06:21,132
Let's start with the Main Street.

135
00:06:21,886 --> 00:06:24,570
Fast food has taken over the whole country; we know that.

136
00:06:24,594 --> 00:06:27,398
The big brands are some of the most important powers,

137
00:06:27,422 --> 00:06:29,262
powerful powers, in this country.

138
00:06:29,872 --> 00:06:30,873
(Sighs)

139
00:06:30,897 --> 00:06:32,196
Supermarkets as well.

140
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,615
Big companies. Big companies.

141
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,990
Thirty years ago, most of the food

142
00:06:38,014 --> 00:06:40,735
was largely local and largely fresh.

143
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:44,118
Now it's largely processed and full of all sorts of additives,

144
00:06:44,142 --> 00:06:46,833
extra ingredients, and you know the rest of the story.

145
00:06:46,857 --> 00:06:49,735
Portion size is obviously a massive, massive problem.

146
00:06:51,436 --> 00:06:53,275
Labeling is a massive problem.

147
00:06:54,092 --> 00:06:56,259
The labeling in this country is a disgrace.

148
00:06:57,249 --> 00:07:01,704
The industry wants to self-police themselves.

149
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,314
What, in this kind of climate? They don't deserve it.

150
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:08,604
How can you say something is low-fat when it's full of so much sugar?

151
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,850
Home.

152
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,607
The biggest problem with the home

153
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:19,735
is that used to be the heart of passing on food culture,

154
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,183
what made our society.

155
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:23,640
That is not happening anymore.

156
00:07:23,664 --> 00:07:26,545
And you know, as we go to work and as life changes,

157
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:28,546
and as life always evolves,

158
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,683
we kind of have to look at it holistically --

159
00:07:30,707 --> 00:07:33,095
step back for a moment, and re-address the balance.

160
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,182
It hasn't happened for 30 years, OK?

161
00:07:36,163 --> 00:07:39,521
I want to show you a situation

162
00:07:39,545 --> 00:07:42,786
that is very normal right now; the Edwards family.

163
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:45,377
(Video) Jamie Oliver: Let's have a talk.

164
00:07:46,231 --> 00:07:50,264
This stuff goes through you and your family's body every week.

165
00:07:50,288 --> 00:07:52,197
And I need you to know

166
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:55,791
that this is going to kill your children early.

167
00:07:56,369 --> 00:07:57,759
How are you feeling?

168
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:01,735
Stacy: Just feeling really sad and depressed right now.

169
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:05,562
But, you know, I want my kids to succeed in life

170
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:07,735
and this isn't going to get them there.

171
00:08:08,568 --> 00:08:10,064
But I'm killing them.

172
00:08:11,474 --> 00:08:14,450
JO: Yes you are. You are.

173
00:08:14,474 --> 00:08:15,686
But we can stop that.

174
00:08:19,576 --> 00:08:20,650
Normal.

175
00:08:21,825 --> 00:08:23,659
Let's get on schools,

176
00:08:23,683 --> 00:08:26,735
something that I'm fairly much a specialist in.

177
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,296
OK, school.

178
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,735
What is school? Who invented it? What's the purpose of school?

179
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,591
School was always invented to arm us with the tools

180
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:37,434
to make us creative, do wonderful things,

181
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,915
make us earn a living, etc., etc.

182
00:08:39,939 --> 00:08:44,097
You know, it's been kind of in this sort of tight box for a long, long time, OK?

183
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,735
But we haven't really evolved it

184
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:50,089
to deal with the health catastrophes of America, OK?

185
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:53,200
School food is something

186
00:08:53,224 --> 00:08:55,882
that most kids -- 31 million a day, actually --

187
00:08:55,906 --> 00:09:00,567
have twice a day, more than often, breakfast and lunch,

188
00:09:00,591 --> 00:09:02,320
180 days of the year.

189
00:09:02,344 --> 00:09:05,519
So you could say that school food is quite important, really,

190
00:09:05,543 --> 00:09:07,129
judging the circumstances.

191
00:09:07,153 --> 00:09:11,169
(Laughter)

192
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,735
Before I crack into my rant,

193
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:16,785
which I'm sure you're waiting for --

194
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:19,856
(Laughter)

195
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,246
I need to say one thing, and it's so important

196
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,977
in, hopefully, the magic that happens and unfolds

197
00:09:25,001 --> 00:09:26,214
in the next three months.

198
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:30,048
The lunch ladies, the lunch cooks of America --

199
00:09:30,072 --> 00:09:33,447
I offer myself as their ambassador.

200
00:09:33,471 --> 00:09:34,957
I'm not slagging them off.

201
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:36,981
They're doing the best they can do.

202
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:41,059
They're doing their best.

203
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:43,591
But they're doing what they're told,

204
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:45,876
and what they're being told to do is wrong.

205
00:09:46,195 --> 00:09:49,432
The system is highly run by accountants;

206
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:53,533
there's not enough, or any, food-knowledgeable people in the business.

207
00:09:53,557 --> 00:09:54,588
There's a problem:

208
00:09:54,612 --> 00:09:57,735
If you're not a food expert, and you've got tight budgets

209
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,469
and it's getting tighter, then you can't be creative,

210
00:10:00,493 --> 00:10:03,632
you can't duck and dive and write different things around things.

211
00:10:03,656 --> 00:10:05,663
If you're an accountant, and a box-ticker,

212
00:10:05,687 --> 00:10:07,933
the only thing you can do in these circumstances

213
00:10:07,957 --> 00:10:08,985
is buy cheaper shit.

214
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,339
Now, the reality is,

215
00:10:10,363 --> 00:10:13,974
the food that your kids get every day is fast food,

216
00:10:13,998 --> 00:10:15,307
it's highly processed,

217
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:17,571
there's not enough fresh food in there at all.

218
00:10:17,595 --> 00:10:19,776
You know, the amount of additives, E numbers,

219
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,506
ingredients you wouldn't believe --

220
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,241
there's not enough veggies at all.

221
00:10:23,265 --> 00:10:25,189
French fries are considered a vegetable.

222
00:10:25,213 --> 00:10:27,735
Pizza for breakfast. They don't even get crockery.

223
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:30,091
Knives and forks? No, they're too dangerous.

224
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,656
They have scissors in the classroom,

225
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,061
but knives and forks? No.

226
00:10:34,085 --> 00:10:35,481
And the way I look at it is:

227
00:10:35,505 --> 00:10:37,894
If you don't have knives and forks in your school,

228
00:10:37,918 --> 00:10:39,457
you're purely endorsing,

229
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:42,553
from a state level, fast food, because it's handheld.

230
00:10:42,577 --> 00:10:44,362
And yes, by the way, it is fast food:

231
00:10:44,386 --> 00:10:45,976
It's sloppy Joes, it's burgers,

232
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,776
it's wieners, it's pizzas, it's all of that stuff.

233
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,463
(Sighs)

234
00:10:52,211 --> 00:10:55,188
Ten percent of what we spend on health care, as I said earlier,

235
00:10:55,212 --> 00:10:57,647
is on obesity, and it's going to double.

236
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,339
We're not teaching our kids.

237
00:11:00,363 --> 00:11:03,068
There's no statutory right to teach kids about food,

238
00:11:03,092 --> 00:11:04,885
elementary or secondary school, OK?

239
00:11:04,909 --> 00:11:07,227
We don't teach kids about food, right?

240
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:09,680
And this is a little clip from an elementary school,

241
00:11:09,704 --> 00:11:11,283
which is very common in England.

242
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:15,288
(Video) Who knows what this is?

243
00:11:15,312 --> 00:11:16,383
Child: Potatoes.

244
00:11:16,407 --> 00:11:18,995
Jamie Oliver: Potato? So, you think these are potatoes?

245
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:20,240
Do you know what that is?

246
00:11:20,553 --> 00:11:21,757
Do you know what that is?

247
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:22,796
Child: Broccoli?

248
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,276
JO: What about this? Our good old friend.

249
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,460
Child: Celery.

250
00:11:26,484 --> 00:11:28,428
JO: No. What do you think this is?

251
00:11:28,452 --> 00:11:29,936
Child: Onion. JO: Onion? No.

252
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,366
JO: Immediately you get a really clear sense

253
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,610
of "Do the kids know anything about where food comes from?"

254
00:11:35,634 --> 00:11:37,611
Who knows what that is? Child: Uh, pear?

255
00:11:37,635 --> 00:11:40,063
JO: What do you think this is? Child: I don't know.

256
00:11:40,087 --> 00:11:42,071
JO: If the kids don't know what stuff is,

257
00:11:42,095 --> 00:11:43,494
then they will never eat it.

258
00:11:45,682 --> 00:11:46,939
(Laughter)

259
00:11:46,963 --> 00:11:49,735
JO: Normal. England and America,

260
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:51,297
England and America.

261
00:11:51,321 --> 00:11:53,464
Guess what fixed that.

262
00:11:53,926 --> 00:11:55,399
Two one-hour sessions.

263
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:00,359
We've got to start teaching our kids about food in schools, period.

264
00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:06,735
(Applause)

265
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,780
I want to tell you about something

266
00:12:10,804 --> 00:12:15,142
that kind of epitomizes the trouble that we're in, guys, OK?

267
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,737
I want to talk about something so basic as milk.

268
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:20,402
Every kid has the right to milk at school.

269
00:12:20,426 --> 00:12:24,022
Your kids will be having milk at school, breakfast and lunch, right?

270
00:12:24,046 --> 00:12:25,844
They'll be having two bottles, OK?

271
00:12:25,868 --> 00:12:27,361
And most kids do.

272
00:12:27,385 --> 00:12:30,170
But milk ain't good enough anymore.

273
00:12:30,194 --> 00:12:32,735
Don't get me wrong, I support milk --

274
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,875
but someone at the milk board

275
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:37,569
probably paid a lot of money for some geezer to work out

276
00:12:37,593 --> 00:12:39,334
that if you put loads of flavorings,

277
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,781
colorings and sugar in milk,

278
00:12:40,805 --> 00:12:42,223
more kids will drink it.

279
00:12:43,464 --> 00:12:44,464
Yeah.

280
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,933
Obviously now that's going to catch on

281
00:12:46,957 --> 00:12:48,743
the apple board is going to work out

282
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,544
that if they make toffee apples they'll eat more as well.

283
00:12:51,568 --> 00:12:52,981
Do you know what I mean?

284
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:56,052
For me, there isn't any need to flavor the milk.

285
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:58,099
Okay? There's sugar in everything.

286
00:12:58,123 --> 00:13:00,272
I know the ins and outs of those ingredients.

287
00:13:00,296 --> 00:13:01,322
It's in everything.

288
00:13:01,346 --> 00:13:04,924
Even the milk hasn't escaped the kind of modern-day problems.

289
00:13:04,948 --> 00:13:06,735
There's our milk. There's our carton.

290
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:11,008
In that is nearly as much sugar as one of your favorite cans of fizzy pop,

291
00:13:11,032 --> 00:13:12,468
and they are having two a day.

292
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,047
So, let me just show you.

293
00:13:14,071 --> 00:13:17,153
We've got one kid, here --

294
00:13:18,846 --> 00:13:22,658
having, you know, eight tablespoons of sugar a day.

295
00:13:23,378 --> 00:13:25,504
You know, there's your week.

296
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:28,115
There's your month.

297
00:13:29,337 --> 00:13:31,532
And I've taken the liberty of putting in

298
00:13:31,556 --> 00:13:34,556
just the five years of elementary school sugar,

299
00:13:38,212 --> 00:13:39,410
just from milk.

300
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:44,579
Now, I don't know about you guys,

301
00:13:44,603 --> 00:13:47,420
but judging the circumstances, right,

302
00:13:47,444 --> 00:13:49,735
any judge in the whole world,

303
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:52,223
would look at the statistics and the evidence,

304
00:13:52,247 --> 00:13:55,532
and they would find any government of old guilty of child abuse.

305
00:13:56,087 --> 00:13:57,191
That's my belief.

306
00:13:57,215 --> 00:14:00,215
(Applause)

307
00:14:04,106 --> 00:14:05,735
(Applause ends)

308
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,051
Now, if I came up here, and I wish I could come up here today

309
00:14:09,075 --> 00:14:11,736
and hang a cure for AIDS or cancer,

310
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,210
you'd be fighting and scrambling to get to me.

311
00:14:15,243 --> 00:14:18,219
This, all this bad news, is preventable.

312
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:20,270
That's the good news.

313
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:22,270
It's very, very preventable.

314
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:25,735
So, let's just think about, we got a problem here,

315
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:26,877
we need to reboot.

316
00:14:28,092 --> 00:14:30,735
Okay so, in my world, what do we need to do?

317
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:32,474
Here is the thing, right,

318
00:14:32,498 --> 00:14:34,735
it cannot just come from one source.

319
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:38,166
To reboot and make real tangible change,

320
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,134
real change, so that I could look you in the white of the eyes

321
00:14:41,158 --> 00:14:42,735
and say, "In 10 years' time,

322
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:44,735
the history of your children's lives,

323
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,807
happiness -- and let's not forget, you're clever if you eat well,

324
00:14:47,831 --> 00:14:49,689
you know you're going to live longer --

325
00:14:49,713 --> 00:14:52,646
all of that stuff, it will look different. OK?"

326
00:14:53,365 --> 00:14:55,071
So, supermarkets.

327
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:57,015
Where else do you shop so religiously?

328
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:58,227
Week in, week out.

329
00:14:58,251 --> 00:15:01,330
How much money do you spend, in your life, in a supermarket?

330
00:15:01,354 --> 00:15:02,362
Love them.

331
00:15:02,386 --> 00:15:04,442
They just sell us what we want. All right.

332
00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:08,925
They owe us to put a food ambassador in every major supermarket.

333
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,021
They need to help us shop.

334
00:15:11,045 --> 00:15:14,735
They need to show us how to cook quick, tasty, seasonal meals

335
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:16,624
for people that are busy.

336
00:15:16,648 --> 00:15:18,617
This is not expensive.

337
00:15:18,641 --> 00:15:21,522
It is done in some, and it needs to be done across the board

338
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,251
in America soon, and quick.

339
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:26,600
The big brands, you know, the food brands,

340
00:15:26,624 --> 00:15:30,349
need to put food education at the heart of their businesses.

341
00:15:30,373 --> 00:15:32,253
I know, easier said than done.

342
00:15:32,277 --> 00:15:34,488
It's the future. It's the only way.

343
00:15:34,512 --> 00:15:36,133
Fast food.

344
00:15:36,157 --> 00:15:38,917
With the fast-food industry

345
00:15:38,941 --> 00:15:40,735
you know, it's very competitive.

346
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:42,854
I've had loads of secret papers and dealings

347
00:15:42,878 --> 00:15:44,596
with fast food restaurants.

348
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,437
I know how they do it.

349
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:48,734
I mean, basically they've weaned us on

350
00:15:48,758 --> 00:15:51,537
to these hits of sugar, salt and fat, and x, y, and z,

351
00:15:51,561 --> 00:15:53,538
and everyone loves them, right?

352
00:15:53,562 --> 00:15:56,758
So, these guys are going to be part of the solution.

353
00:15:56,782 --> 00:15:58,735
But we need to get the government to work

354
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:01,807
with all of the fast food purveyors and the restaurant industry,

355
00:16:01,831 --> 00:16:03,880
and over a five, six, seven year period

356
00:16:03,904 --> 00:16:06,223
wean of us off the extreme amounts

357
00:16:06,247 --> 00:16:09,735
of fat, sugar and all the other non-food ingredients.

358
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,041
Now, also, back to the sort of big brands:

359
00:16:12,065 --> 00:16:15,247
labeling, I said earlier, is an absolute farce

360
00:16:15,271 --> 00:16:16,682
and has got to be sorted.

361
00:16:18,062 --> 00:16:19,387
OK, school.

362
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:22,735
Obviously, in schools, we owe it to them

363
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:24,735
to make sure those 180 days of the year,

364
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:26,735
from that little precious age of four,

365
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,735
until 18, 20, 24, whatever,

366
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:33,610
they need to be cooked proper, fresh food

367
00:16:33,634 --> 00:16:35,735
from local growers on site, OK?

368
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,285
There needs to be a new standard of fresh, proper food

369
00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:39,735
for your children, yeah?

370
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,188
(Applause)

371
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:47,648
Under the circumstances, it's profoundly important

372
00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:50,241
that every single American child leaves school

373
00:16:50,265 --> 00:16:52,242
knowing how to cook 10 recipes

374
00:16:52,266 --> 00:16:53,615
that will save their life.

375
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:55,838
Life skills.

376
00:16:55,862 --> 00:16:58,059
(Applause)

377
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,121
That means that they can be students, young parents,

378
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:05,384
and be able to sort of duck and dive around the basics of cooking,

379
00:17:05,408 --> 00:17:07,511
no matter what recession hits them next time.

380
00:17:07,535 --> 00:17:09,917
If you can cook, recession money doesn't matter.

381
00:17:09,941 --> 00:17:12,412
If you can cook, time doesn't matter.

382
00:17:13,954 --> 00:17:16,399
The workplace, we haven't really talked about it.

383
00:17:16,423 --> 00:17:19,985
You know, it's now time for corporate responsibility

384
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:24,033
to really look at what they feed or make available to their staff.

385
00:17:24,057 --> 00:17:27,367
The staff are the moms and dads of America's children.

386
00:17:27,391 --> 00:17:29,550
Marissa, her father died in her hand,

387
00:17:29,574 --> 00:17:31,551
I think she'd be quite happy

388
00:17:31,575 --> 00:17:34,735
if corporate America could start feeding their staff properly.

389
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:36,735
Definitely they shouldn't be left out.

390
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:38,325
Let's go back to the home.

391
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:40,589
Now, look, if we do all this stuff, and we can,

392
00:17:40,613 --> 00:17:41,686
it's so achievable.

393
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,452
You can care and be commercial.

394
00:17:43,476 --> 00:17:44,499
Absolutely.

395
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:49,518
But the home needs to start passing on cooking again, for sure.

396
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:51,518
For sure, pass it on as a philosophy.

397
00:17:52,032 --> 00:17:53,676
And for me, it's quite romantic,

398
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,093
but it's about if one person teaches three people

399
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,735
how to cook something,

400
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,499
and they teach three of their mates,

401
00:17:59,523 --> 00:18:01,847
that only has to repeat itself 25 times,

402
00:18:01,871 --> 00:18:04,126
and that's the whole population of America.

403
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:08,450
Romantic, yes, but most importantly,

404
00:18:08,474 --> 00:18:11,165
it's about trying to get people to realize

405
00:18:11,189 --> 00:18:14,173
that every one of your individual efforts makes a difference.

406
00:18:14,197 --> 00:18:16,397
We've got to put back what's been lost.

407
00:18:16,891 --> 00:18:18,113
Huntington's Kitchen.

408
00:18:18,754 --> 00:18:21,025
Huntington, where I made this program,

409
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:22,636
we've got this prime-time program

410
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,848
that hopefully will inspire people to really get on this change.

411
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:27,903
I truly believe that change will happen.

412
00:18:27,927 --> 00:18:30,094
Huntington's Kitchen. I work with a community.

413
00:18:30,118 --> 00:18:31,599
I worked in the schools.

414
00:18:31,623 --> 00:18:33,888
I found local sustainable funding

415
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:38,198
to get every single school in the area from the junk, onto the fresh food:

416
00:18:38,222 --> 00:18:40,091
six-and-a-half grand per school.

417
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:41,965
(Applause)

418
00:18:41,989 --> 00:18:44,485
That's all it takes, six-and-a-half grand per school.

419
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:46,912
The Kitchen is 25 grand a month. Okay?

420
00:18:46,936 --> 00:18:49,811
This can do 5,000 people a year,

421
00:18:49,835 --> 00:18:51,953
which is 10 percent of their population,

422
00:18:51,977 --> 00:18:53,358
and it's people on people.

423
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,683
You know, it's local cooks teaching local people.

424
00:18:55,707 --> 00:18:59,293
It's free cooking lessons, guys, in the Main Street.

425
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:03,446
This is real, tangible change, real, tangible change.

426
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:07,265
Around America, if we just look back now,

427
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:09,692
there is plenty of wonderful things going on.

428
00:19:10,393 --> 00:19:12,502
There is plenty of beautiful things going on.

429
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,735
There are angels around America doing great things

430
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:18,656
in schools -- farm-to-school set-ups,

431
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,291
garden set-ups, education --

432
00:19:21,315 --> 00:19:23,412
there are amazing people doing this already.

433
00:19:23,436 --> 00:19:25,365
The problem is they all want to roll out

434
00:19:25,389 --> 00:19:27,524
what they're doing to the next school,

435
00:19:27,548 --> 00:19:28,896
but there's no cash.

436
00:19:29,816 --> 00:19:33,516
We need to recognize the experts and the angels quickly,

437
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,735
identify them, and allow them to easily find the resource

438
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,999
to keep rolling out what they're already doing,

439
00:19:39,023 --> 00:19:40,023
and doing well.

440
00:19:40,607 --> 00:19:42,879
Businesses of America need to support

441
00:19:42,903 --> 00:19:45,735
Mrs. Obama to do the things that she wants to do.

442
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:52,158
(Applause)

443
00:19:52,182 --> 00:19:54,128
And look, I know it's weird

444
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:56,735
having an English person standing here before you

445
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:58,200
talking about all this.

446
00:19:58,224 --> 00:19:59,572
All I can say is: I care.

447
00:20:00,128 --> 00:20:01,550
I'm a father,

448
00:20:01,574 --> 00:20:02,915
and I love this country.

449
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:06,361
And I believe truly, actually,

450
00:20:06,385 --> 00:20:09,234
that if change can be made in this country,

451
00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:11,441
beautiful things will happen around the world.

452
00:20:11,465 --> 00:20:13,600
If America does it, other people will follow.

453
00:20:13,624 --> 00:20:15,020
It's incredibly important.

454
00:20:15,396 --> 00:20:16,464
(Audience) Yeah!

455
00:20:16,488 --> 00:20:22,119
(Applause)

456
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,421
When I was in Huntington,

457
00:20:23,445 --> 00:20:26,069
trying to get a few things to work when they weren't,

458
00:20:26,093 --> 00:20:31,404
I thought "If I had a magic wand, what would I do?"

459
00:20:31,428 --> 00:20:32,985
And I thought, "You know what?

460
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:36,292
I'd just love to be put in front of some of the most amazing

461
00:20:36,316 --> 00:20:38,080
movers and shakers in America."

462
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,087
And a month later, TED phoned me up and gave me this award.

463
00:20:43,552 --> 00:20:44,607
I'm here.

464
00:20:47,274 --> 00:20:48,456
So, my wish.

465
00:20:53,494 --> 00:20:55,256
Dyslexic, so I'm a bit slow.

466
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,735
My wish

467
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:06,890
is for you to help a strong, sustainable movement

468
00:21:06,914 --> 00:21:10,588
to educate every child

469
00:21:10,612 --> 00:21:13,000
about food,

470
00:21:13,024 --> 00:21:16,539
to inspire families to cook again,

471
00:21:16,563 --> 00:21:19,224
and to empower people everywhere

472
00:21:19,248 --> 00:21:20,771
to fight obesity.

473
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:24,863
(Applause)

474
00:21:32,002 --> 00:21:33,055
Thank you.

475
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:36,079
(Applause continues)
